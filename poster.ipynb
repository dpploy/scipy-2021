The runoff from the high-pressure turbine is then split in half and fed to the two low-pressure turbines, which expand the runoff to 0.5 bar. The runoff is then fed to a condenser which produces subcooled liquid water, which is then fed back into the bottom of the reactor.\n",

    "Additionally, a number of the calculations used in this model rely on the [IAPWS](https://pypi.org/project/iapws/) library developed by Juan José Gómez Romera (jjgomera). IAPWS is the International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam, which develops power series that can be used to calculate properties of water and steam (such as specific enthalpy and entropy) at a variety of temperatures, pressures and qualities. The IAPWS library devloped by jjgomera implements these series as python functions which can be easily accessed and called to calculate any property required for thermodynamic calculations, drastically simplifying the process of modelling the two-phase systems in use by the turbine and condenser modules. This project specifically uses the IAPWS97 module within the library, which uses the formulations published in 1997 by IAPWS foundation as an update to ones developed in 1967. "

This will reduce the density of the water, and therefore its effectiveness as a moderator. We would expect that this would lead to lower reactivity, and the equation developed below reflects this.

    "A boiling water reactor will typically use several different turbines, either designed to expand high-pressure steam drawn directly off the top of the reactor, or to expand lower-pressure runoff steam drawn from the high-pressure turbines. This is typically done to improve thermodynamic efficiency and avoid condensation of the steam within the turbines themselves. Our model contains a single high-pressure turbine which expands steam coming off the top of the reactor to around 5 bar; There are also two low-pressure turbines which expand the runoff from the high-pressure turbine to 0.05 bar. Both of these different types of turbine use the same model but different parameters to determine runoff temperature and the amount of power generated.\n",

    "\n",
    "The evolution of the plant from startup to shutdown is carried out by message passing (either using the Message Passing Interface for Python or native Python multiprocessing pipes) of time-dependent data specified by the connectivity of the [Cortix](https://cortix.org) network. Each module on the network runs on its own process or thread and data is sychronized by message passing through ports of the modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "The plant network model results follow a sigmoid shape up to the steady state point which would be expected in real plant operation. Some of the individual steady state values (i.e. the power produced by the turbines) are qualitatively similar to real operation, but improvement of the parameters used could make the model quantitatively enhanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Cortix](https://cortix.org) library is instrumental in modeling dynamic systems with multiple modules. Further work could be done to scale the system into a much larger more complex plant, including additional turbines and unit operations such as pumping or safety systems."
