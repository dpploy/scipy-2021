The runoff is then fed to a condenser which produces subcooled liquid water, which is then fed back into the bottom of the reactor.\n",

IAPWS is the International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam, which develops power series that can be used to calculate properties of water and steam (such as specific enthalpy and entropy) at a variety of temperatures, pressures and qualities. The IAPWS library devloped by jjgomera implements these series as python functions which can be easily accessed and called to calculate any property required for thermodynamic calculations, drastically simplifying the process of modelling the two-phase systems in use by the turbine and condenser modules. This project specifically uses the IAPWS97 module within the library, which uses the formulations published in 1997 by IAPWS foundation as an update to ones developed in 1967. "

This simplified model contains a single high-pressure turbine which expands steam coming off the top of the reactor to around 5 bar; There are also two low-pressure turbines which expand the runoff from the high-pressure turbine to 0.05 bar.
