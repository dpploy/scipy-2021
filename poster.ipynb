    "Steam is created from nuclear heat generated in the reactor and passed to the high-pressure turbine, which expands the steam to about 0.5 MPA (or 5 bar). The runoff from the high-pressure turbine is then split in half and fed to the two low-pressure turbines, which expand the runoff to 0.5 bar. The runoff is then fed to a condenser which produces subcooled liquid water, which is then fed back into the bottom of the reactor.\n",

    "Additionally, a number of the calculations used in this model rely on the [IAPWS](https://pypi.org/project/iapws/) library developed by Juan JosÃ© GÃ³mez Romera (jjgomera). IAPWS is the International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam, which develops power series that can be used to calculate properties of water and steam (such as specific enthalpy and entropy) at a variety of temperatures, pressures and qualities. The IAPWS library devloped by jjgomera implements these series as python functions which can be easily accessed and called to calculate any property required for thermodynamic calculations, drastically simplifying the process of modelling the two-phase systems in use by the turbine and condenser modules. This project specifically uses the IAPWS97 module within the library, which uses the formulations published in 1997 by IAPWS foundation as an update to ones developed in 1967. "

Both loops are maintained at a constant pressure and the flow is assumed to be counter current. While having a steam generator or any heat exchanger in counter current is the superior option for steam generation, it does provide a headache for those who wish to model them computationally.
