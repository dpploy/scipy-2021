    "\n",
    "The nuclear power industry has a long history in using modeling and simulation to design nuclear systems. Both\n",
    "experience and existing simulation software can be leveraged to build modeling capabilities to extended balance of\n",
    "plants (BoPs). Here we adopt a divide-and-conquer approach for modeling and simulation wherein significant sub-systems are modeled individually and coupled via an external framework. \n",
    "\n",
    "A power plant has many sub-systems that appear repeatedly, either physically or logically, say a feed water system composed of many individual water heaters, or a Rankine turbine with many regenerative heating steps. In both cases, a network can be built for all the components, and a dynamic model assembled to represent an extended BoP. A key capability requirement of the\n",
    "framework is to allow for scalability and reusability of computational modules. Given the current status of modern\n",
    "computing power, extended BoP’s can now be created to various levels of detail; for instance, valves and pipes can\n",
    "be included explicitly in the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "An extended network can be mapped on large scale parallel computing\n",
    "platforms to allow for increasingly modeling fidelity. This forward picture calls for a broader understanding of the\n",
    "elements of a power plant and the coupling of the corresponding flow of energy. This is the primary motivation of\n",
    "this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "We developed and used five system-level modules to represent a nuclear facility. These modules included a reactor,\n",
    "a steam generator, a turbine, a condenser, and a feedwater heating system. The primary loop flows between the\n",
    "reactor module and the steam generator, while the secondary loop flows from the water heater, to the steam\n",
    "generator, to the turbine, to the condenser, where it then flows back to the water heater. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `Cortix` Python library\n",
    "was used to connect each of the modules. This was done by connecting information streams through inflow and\n",
    "outflow *ports* on each of the modules. We also created an accident scenario where the secondary loop’s mass\n",
    "flowrate was temporarily reduced so we could see the effect it would have on our system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [`IAPWS`](https://github.com/jjgomera/iapws) Python library was fully coupled to systematically compute the thermodynamic and physical properties of water and steam at many different conditions. By coupling the system level models through [Cortix](https://cortix.org), and using [`SciPy`](https://www.scipy.org) mathematical modules (ODE\n",
    "integrator) we were able to create an extended time-dependent BoP system which can be used to examine and model\n",
    "how startup, shutdown, and loss of coolant accidents impact each part of the plant.\n"

    "Steam is created from nuclear heat generated in the reactor and passed to the high-pressure turbine, which expands the steam to about 0.5 MPA (or 5 bar). The runoff from the high-pressure turbine is then split in half and fed to the two low-pressure turbines, which expand the runoff to 0.5 bar. The runoff is then fed to a condenser which produces subcooled liquid water, which is then fed back into the bottom of the reactor.\n",

Both loops are maintained at a constant pressure and the flow is assumed to be counter current.

There is also an option to add another electric heating source, but it set to 0 for this simulation. There is a maximum power taken for the water heater and it is set at 25 MW. This is to ensure that no actual boiling occurs in this module because it is not set up to handle multiphase flow. The water heater also has the unique feature of having an accident scenario that can manipulated to turn on and off at specified times.
